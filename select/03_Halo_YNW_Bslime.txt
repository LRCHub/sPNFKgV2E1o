Do the race like my name Tay-K
Spin your block like I was a Beyblade
Got a knife up straight to your face
This situation can go both ways
It can leave you dead or alive
Choose right, one can leave you fried
With a extra side of fries
Want beef? Pull up, five guys
Oh my God, feel so alive
Snatch his chain, not playin' nice
Ten shots to his brain after
Let this chopper preach like a pastor
And I stay up on this set
You know I be for the neck
Oh no, oh wait
Yeah, it's time to go, let's skate
